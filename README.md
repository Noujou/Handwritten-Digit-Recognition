# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This repository contains an implementation of a handwritten digit recognition system using deep learning. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark for digit recognition tasks.

Overview
The goal of this project is to leverage deep neural networks to accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) based on images provided as input. The model architecture includes layers for processing the image data, and dropout layers for regularization to enhance generalization.

Features
Neural Network Architecture: The model architecture includes fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions to capture complex patterns in the input data.

Dropout for Regularization: Dropout layers are incorporated during training to prevent overfitting, promoting better generalization to unseen data.
